# tutorChecker
## A command-line program for math tutors

Hi everyone! I work as a math tutor, and we keep our answer keys online.

The staff portal broke today, so I ended up writing some code to check some of my students answers. This is that code!

There's a few functions throughout, but the one I'm most proud of is a long division calculator. This is generally for grades 4-6.
