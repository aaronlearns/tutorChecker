## Long division, mixed numbers and more!

Hi everyone! I work as a math tutor, and we keep our answer keys online.

The staff portal broke today, so I ended up writing some code to check some of my students answers. This is that code!

There's a few functions throughout, but the one I'm most proud of is a long division calculator with multiple modes.
