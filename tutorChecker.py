These functions find GCF (greatest common factor) or LCM (least common multiple)
of two numbers.

They do this by finding taking the elements of certain sets, then finding their product.

The GCF is the intersection of the prime factor sets.
The LCM is the union of these sets.

Technically, we could do this for any amount of numbers,
but I'm not sure the runtime's that good.
